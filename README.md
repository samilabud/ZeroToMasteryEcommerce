# Web Project - E-commerce

This final project, developed in collaboration with the Zero to Mastery team as part of the "Complete React Developer" course in 2021, is a sophisticated e-commerce application. 

It leverages advanced technologies including React (with *Redux*, *Hooks*, *Saga*, and *HOCs*) and integrates with Stripe for payment processing and Firebase for backend services. 

The application supports user registration and allows seamless purchase experiences across both PC and mobile devices. The underlying API, which I personally developed, is hosted at `samecommercews.onrender.com`.
